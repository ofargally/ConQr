# ConQr
A very helpful app for learning language through online immersion. It has two main parts:

(1) Extend-ConQr
--> A chrome extension for managing a variety of linguistic inputs such as text, audio, etc. Text wil be emphasized first in the early stage of development 
(2) Main ConQr Platform 
--> A full stack web application that will use React and Node.js to power the platform. The application will be integrated with a custom LLM agent and will incorporate an SRS algorithm for word/sentence memorization and association.

I am not sure how much of this app I will get done, but I will try. The philosophy is as follows:
--> upper-beginner/lower-intermediate learners are in need of a vast amount of input - something that could be done through browsing native content. But it usually is too hard and making so many flashcards with powerful apps like ANKI might be daunting. Instead of spending hours making and memorizing flashcards, I thought maybe there is a better way to remember words/meanings in a more engaging way; and that could be through building an LLM-powered SRS algorithm.

LLM-powered SRS:
-> I will use the same concept of SRS but isntead of building flashcards, I will channel the content to be learned to a custom LLM agent that will be trained/finetuned on initiating conversations with the user/giving and interacting engagingly using the words/sentences that are supposed to be learned for that day. 

The idea seems sound on paper but I am still not sure how the LLM behavior should playout for optimal learning gains. But, at least to me, it seems like a more fun way to engage with the learned material. 

my SRS algorithm may not only be based on time - i might need to make a system whereby words/constructions could be flagged as learned/frequency/appropriate for user's current level, etc. I am not quite sure what makes the most since yet.

Other features:
-> I am planning to add a number of other features that will supplement this aforementioned paradigm:
(1) Learning Statistics
(2) word tracking, maybe content suggestion based on the analysis of the words the user seems to be interested in.
(3) We will see.
